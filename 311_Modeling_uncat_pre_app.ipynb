       "       \"They have changed the manner in which the public can obtain computer print outs. I had to insert $1.00 into a machine for a one page print out. You used to only have to pay for one page. It appears that SJSU is seeking to make considerable profit with WEPA. Why does the public have to overpay WEPA? Why can I no longer simply pay for the 1 or 2 pages of print outs? The only pay machine on the 2nd floor requires you to purchase a VIP Gold Card. Was the City of San Jose aware of this change? This new system seems to be clever scam on cheating the public and causing excessive funds to flow into SJSU. I hope the City of San Jose will investigate this highly questionable WEPA process. It certainly seems to be illegal and unethical forcing a non-student to overpay for a computer printout and to be required to purchase a VIP Gold Card. They gave us no advance warning of this change and hardly no clear instructions. You wouldn't believe how many library employees have stated that WEPA is a terrible system. WEPA does not pass the smell test. It sure looks like a sneaky way to get their hands on additional funds at the expense of the public. Not to mention the additional plastic produced only to end up in the Pacific Patch!\",\n",

       "       'To City of San Jose City Council, Hi, I\\'d like to know if I can count on your support for the City to understand the religious use of cannabis. City collective laws don\\'t apply nor the non-medical laws apply. I\\'m asking you for an emergency letter of registration to allow me to apply and become state licensed under SB 829 Compassionate Care License with the State of California. I have given away about the most free cannabis in all my years working with the City as Golden State Care Collective 2010-2014 to the poor and needy. Doing my religious service and ministry before God, was maliciously persecuted for 1st amendment, Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Religion in 2013. And now I need your support. Can I make an appointment with you? I have fwded you the email string between lobbyist in San Francisco and myself. Its an urgent matter because SB420 will become repealed Jan 1 2019 and the Collective model will dissolve as if it has never passed. Collectives will no longer be legal. However, my goal is to get my Compassionate Care License with your letter of registration, with your support. How can you make this happen before it\\'s too late and sick die in pain night after night without the pain relieving cannabis. I\\'m Native American and have been my entire life. I\\'m a member of the Native American Church and founder of Sacrament Collective Pentecostal Church. I am protected by those rights especially the 1st amendment: 2)Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  Bill Text - SB-829 Cannabis: compassion care license. Bill Text - SB-829 Cannabis: compassion care license. http://www.cannabusiness.com/news/politics-legislation/police-storm-native-american-churches-using-cannabis/  News article Attorney Mathew Pappas states, \"these are churches, not marijuana dispensaries.\" Cannabis belief to use as a sacrament is religious use so, it\\'s not considered an illegal substance referred to as \"contraband\" and by doing so is an error. It\\'s Church use so according to the IRS it\\'s automatically granted 501 c3 status bc it\\'s not required to apply for 501 c3 status as a church. The federal law states where there is a state exemption their should be a religious one aswell. So, Prop 64 is the state exemption and RELIGIOUS use already granted to those who invoke it per the First Amendment, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of RELIGION, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"  42 USC CHAPTER 21B – RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments of 1994 PROVIDERS DECLARATION OF NINTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS Deprivation of rights under color of law.

       "       'After 30 years living in Cambrian, Kathy and I are relocating to Oregon to be closer to some of our grandchildren. Our house on 4939 Anna Drive is scheduled to close in late January. We underwent an extensive remodel in 1996-97. We recently learned that our contractor, Doug Perraso  (who ironically, we believe,  is currently employed by the City of San Jose Planning, Building and Code Enforcement Dept.) never completed the final inspection with the city. So we are asking for help to expedite the completion of this process, so we can provide the final inspection paperwork for the new homeowners. I left a voicemail for Doug last week, and will attempt to contact him again on Thursday morning,1/2. I will also be there on Thursday afternoon to determine our next steps. We appreciate anything you can do to help us. Regards- Herb Schwarz  (408)568-3917',\n",
