I spent 12 years building my account until the day that customer support stopped access to the account on LinkedIn.com. I have never submitted a post even 1 time and could not get to understand the reasons they locked the account. I submitted many appeals but the customer Support did not want to state or explain the problem in any transparent way, a zero transparency and zero communicative service.    This decision is absolutely unfair and is never appreciated, a discouraging and flawed user policies that do not serve the benefit of a customer. Mistakes and bad policies have happened in LinkedIn and many other companies. The path does not go both ways, and the design of rules there is lacking significantly. There is not a point of using a service if the website is not even willing to resolve simple problems. Given their capabilities, the website needs to live up to the standards and expectations for user service.   I disagree with this decision and will never be okay with this zero transparency user service. Customer support needs to state the problem so I can resolve it.  An Official needs to contact LinkedIn.com customer support to review the appeal and restore access to the account. It would be greatly appreciated if you can help resolve this problem.

These calls are now coming to by wife as well. When I have challenged the caller in the past by telling them I will call back in though the main line when they are at their desk, they freak, so I know it's a fraud call. But often times I leave the call unreturned as I have no outstanding business with either. Q: Is there a number or website for both organizations that I can use to validate that a caller is or isn't a member of law enforcement. If genuine, I do want to help, but only after validation of the caller.   Thanks, Chris\",\n",
